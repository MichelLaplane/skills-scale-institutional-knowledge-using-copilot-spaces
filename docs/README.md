# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to OctoAcme's project management processes and practices. These docs support effective project delivery by documenting our methodologies, roles, artifacts, and workflows. They also serve as valuable context for Copilot Spaces, enabling AI-assisted collaboration that aligns with our established practices.

## Project Management Processes Summary

OctoAcme follows a structured yet flexible approach to project management:

- **Customer-first**: We prioritize customer value and usability in all decisions and deliverables.
- **Iterative delivery**: We deliver small, testable increments to enable rapid feedback and continuous improvement.
- **Defined roles**: Clear ownership and responsibilities across Project Managers (PM), Product Leads, Developers, QA, and Stakeholders.
- **Core artifacts**: We maintain key documents including Project Charter, Roadmap, Backlog, Acceptance Criteria, Risk Register, and Retrospectives.
- **Lifecycle phases**: Our projects follow a structured lifecycle: Initiation → Planning → Execution → Release → Retrospective.
- **Communication cadence**: Regular touchpoints including weekly syncs, standups, monthly updates, and ad-hoc escalations as needed.
